National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2024
by Central Ground Water Board, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
- Total annual groundwater recharge: 446.90 bcm.
- Annual extractable groundwater resources: 406.19 bcm.
- Annual groundwater extraction (2024): 245.64 bcm.
- Average stage of groundwater extraction: 60.47%.
- Total assessment units (Blocks/Mandals/Taluks): 6746.
  - Over-exploited (>100% extraction): 751 units (11.13%).
  - Critical (90-100% extraction): 206 units (3.05%).
  - Semi-critical (70-90% extraction): 711 units (10.54%).
  - Safe (<70% extraction): 4951 units (73.39%).
  - Saline: 127 units (1.88%).
- States/UTs with over 25% of units in 'Over-exploited' or 'Critical' categories: Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Daman & Diu.
- Over-exploited areas are concentrated in:
  1. North-western India (Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Western UP) due to indiscriminate withdrawals.
  2. Western India (Rajasthan, Gujarat) due to arid climate and limited recharge.
  3. Southern Peninsular India (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh) due to low storage of crystalline aquifers.
- Major source of groundwater recharge is rainfall (61%).
- Agriculture sector is the largest consumer of groundwater (87% of total extraction).

Concept of Ground Water Prospects Maps preparation using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System for Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission Project.
Executed by National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).

Key Concepts:
- Groundwater is a major source for over 90% of rural and 30% of urban drinking water in India.
- It accounts for 60% of total irrigation potential.
- Groundwater occurrence depends on geology, rainfall, and geomorphology.
- Hydrogeomorphic units (aquifers) are homogenous areas with respect to hydrogeological properties.
- Satellite data is used to map rock formations, landforms, and structures to identify prospective groundwater zones.
- Ground Water Prospects Maps are prepared on a 1:50,000 scale to show:
  a) Prospective zones for ground water occurrence.
  b) Tentative locations for constructing recharge structures.
- Methods for groundwater exploration include surface investigations (geophysical surveys like electrical resistivity) and subsurface investigations (drilling, pumping tests).
- 'Safe Yield' is the pumping rate that will not cause long-term depletion of the aquifer.
